You are one of God's mistakes
You crying tragic waste of skin
I'm well aware of how it aches
And you still won't let me in
Now I'm breaking down your door
To try and save your swollen face
Though I don't like you anymore
You lying trying waste of space
Before our innocence was lost
You were always one of those blessed with lucky sevens
And the voice that made me cry
